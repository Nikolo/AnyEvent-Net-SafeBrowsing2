AnyEvent-Net-SafeBrowsing2 version 1.13
=====================================

AnyEvent::Net::SafeBrowsing2 implements the Safe Browsing v2 API.

The library passes most of the unit tests listed in the API documentation. 
See the documentation (http://code.google.com/apis/safebrowsing/developers_guide_v2.html) for more details about the failed tests.

The Safe Browsing database must be stored and managed locally.
AnyEvent::Net::SafeBrowsing2::Tarantool uses Tarantool as the storage back-end.
Other storage mechanisms (databases, memory, etc.) can be added and used transparently with this module.

You may want to look at "Google Safe Browsing v2: Implementation Notes" (http://www.zscaler.com/research/Google%20Safe%20Browsing%20v2%20API.pdf), a collection of notes and real-world numbers about the API. This is intended for people who want to learn more about the API, whether as a user or to make their own implementation.

The source code is available on github at https://github.com/Nikolo/AnyEvent-Net-SafeBrowsing2.git.
